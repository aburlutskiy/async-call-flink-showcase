# Flink Async HTTP Processor

This repository contains a sample project that demonstrates how to use Flink Async I/O to call HTTP external services asynchronously. The project is built using Apache Flink 1.17 and Java 11.

Setup
To build and run the project, you will need to have the following installed on your system:

Apache Flink 1.17
Java 11
Maven 3.x
Once you have these dependencies installed, you can build the project using Maven:

go
Copy code
mvn clean package

Usage
To use the async HTTP client in your Flink application, you can create an instance of the AsyncHttpClient class and call its sendAsync() method to make asynchronous HTTP requests. Here's an example:

java
Copy code
import org.apache.flink.streaming.api.functions.async.AsyncFunction;
import org.apache.flink.streaming.api.functions.async.ResultFuture;
import org.apache.flink.streaming.api.functions.async.collector.AsyncCollector;

public class HttpAsyncFunction implements AsyncFunction<String, String> {

    private transient AsyncHttpClient asyncHttpClient;

    @Override
    public void open(Configuration parameters) {
        asyncHttpClient = new AsyncHttpClient();
    }

    @Override
    public void asyncInvoke(String input, ResultFuture<String> resultFuture) {
        asyncHttpClient.sendAsync(HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                .uri(URI.create("https://example.com/api"))
                .GET()
                .build())
            .thenApply(HttpResponse::body)
            .thenAccept(resultFuture::complete);
    }

    @Override
    public void timeout(String input, ResultFuture<String> resultFuture) {
        resultFuture.completeExceptionally(new TimeoutException());
    }

    @Override
    public void close() {
        asyncHttpClient.close();
    }
}
In this example, the HttpAsyncFunction class implements the AsyncFunction interface, which allows it to be used in a Flink application's asynchronous I/O pipeline. In the asyncInvoke() method, it creates a new instance of the AsyncHttpClient class and uses it to send an HTTP GET request to https://example.com/api. When the response is received, the thenApply() and thenAccept() methods are used to extract and complete the result future with the response body. The timeout() method is used to handle timeout exceptions.
